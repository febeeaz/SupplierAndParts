This project is based on the Suppliers and Parts Database, a relational database used to explore and practice fundamental database concepts such as schema creation, data loading, and query execution using MySQL.

The database contains three relations:

SUPPLIER - Information about suppliers.
PART - Details of parts available.
SHIPMENT - Data on shipments linking suppliers and parts.
This repository includes all required files to:

Create, load, and query the database.
Perform various operations such as sorting, filtering, and aggregating data.

Files in the Repository: 
1. ClearDB.sql
Contains SQL statements to drop all three database relations: SUPPLIER, PART, and SHIPMENT.
2. CreateDB.sql
Defines the schema for the database.
Includes constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, and data validation rules.
3. LoadDB.sql
Populates the database with the given data for SUPPLIER, PART, and SHIPMENT.
4. Query_m3.sql and Query_m4.sql
A collection of SQL queries to solve the assignment tasks.
Each query includes comments explaining its purpose.

This project was submitted for a Database Management Systems course.
